1. High-Level Performance Overview (The "What")
Start with the big picture. Use the overall accuracy and the `weighted avg F1-score` from your classification reports to establish a clear performance ranking.
2. Genre-Specific Strengths and Weaknesses (The "Where")
Move from the general to the specific. Discuss which genres were "easy" (high F1-scores across all models, like 'classical') and which were "hard" (lower F1-scores).
3. Analysis of Confusion Patterns (The "Why")
This is the most insightful part of your summary. Use your notes from the heatmap analysis to explain *why* certain genres were hard to classify. Discuss the most common confusion pairs (e.g., rock vs. country, blues vs. jazz) and, for each pair, explicitly compare which model performed best.
4. Final Model Profiles and Recommendation
Conclude with a brief profile for each model, summarizing its performance, and then make your final, decisive recommendation.
